# GeoSpatial Analysis Project
Geospatial Analysis of Frequent Locations and Movement Patterns class project for Cpts 475 Data Science

### Purpose:
This project focuses on analyzing an individual’s location data to identify frequently visited
places and movement patterns. The goal is to determine the top 5 locations where the individual
spends the most time each month and to evaluate the cumulative time spent at these key spots.
By mapping the sequence of movements between these locations, we can gain insights into
habitual routes and routines. The project will also explore clustering techniques and geospatial
visualization, with an optional challenge to predict the individual’s next likely destination based
on observed patterns.
### Tasks:
* Identify the top 5 locations where the individual spends the most time each month.
* Calculate the total time spent at each key location.
* Map the typical movement sequence between these frequent locations.
* Apply clustering algorithms to analyze location patterns.
* Use geospatial visualization tools to represent movement and location data.
* (Optional) Predict the individual's next probable destination based on the movement patterns.
